            "1.  **Tackle that Electricity Bill (especially the AC!):**  Wow, electricity is a big one! Let's make it easier on your wallet and the planet.  Think about how you use your AC.  Could you raise the thermostat a couple of degrees? Even a small change can make a big difference. Also, simple things like turning off lights when you leave a room and unplugging electronics you're not using (they often draw power even when off) can add up. If possible, look into energy-efficient appliances when it's time to replace your old ones - they can save you money in the long run too!\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Make Small Shifts in Your Diet:**  Your diet is the second largest footprint, so even small changes can make a big impact!  Try incorporating one or two plant-based meals each week. You don't have to go full vegetarian or vegan, but swapping a beef dish for a lentil soup, for example, can drastically reduce your food-related emissions. You can also try to reduce food waste by planning your meals and using leftovers creatively.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Be a Car Travel Champion:** Car travel comes in at number 3! Are there any trips you could consolidate or combine? Could you walk, bike or even carpool for short distances?  It's great exercise and saves on fuel! If you can't avoid driving, making sure your tires are properly inflated and avoiding aggressive driving can improve your fuel efficiency.\n",
